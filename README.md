Pithos for Windows
=============

Pithos is a native Pandora Radio client for ~~Linux~~ Windows. It's much more lightweight
than the Pandora.com web client.

Installation
-----------
The installer is still a work in progress but check in the downloads section for one. There will be a minimal installer for updating or others who already have python. See [windows/redist.txt](https://github.com/TingPing/pithos-for-windows/blob/master/windows/redist.txt) for what you need installed.
