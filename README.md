=============

Pithos is a native Pandora Radio client for ~~Linux~~ Windows. It's much more lightweight
than the Pandora.com web client.

Installation
-----------
The installer is still a work in progress but check in the downloads section for one. There will be a minimal installer for updating or others who already have python. See windows/redist.txt for what you need installed.
